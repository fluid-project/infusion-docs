title: Infusion node.js Support and API
layout: default

Infusion's [core API](CoreAPI.md) and [IoC system](HowToUseInfusionIoC.md) are fully supported in node.js. Infusion is
supplied with a standard [package.json](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/package.json) file and
registered as a module in [npm's registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/infusion). Infusion's global namespace model,
as operated through functions such as [`fluid.registerNamespace`](CoreAPI.md#fluidregisternamespacepath) and
[`fluid.defaults`](CoreAPI.md#fluiddefaultsgradename-options), requires some care in the node.js environment which makes
significant efforts to balkanise modules one from another, and to ensure that precisely this kind of thing never occurs
— reference to artifacts held in a single, shared global namespace.

## Accessing and exporting global names

Given that node.js ensures that each module's global object is scrubbed clean of any potentially contaminating
references, you will need to make liberal use of Infusion's
[fluid.registerNamespace](CoreAPI.md#fluidregisternamespacepath) API in order to import such references back into your
scope. Statements like

```javascript
var colin = fluid.registerNamespace("colin");
```

are common in the preamble to node-aware, Infusion-aware `.js` files. Note that you will still need to make calls to
node.js's standard `require` implementation if the code or definitions you wish to reference have not been loaded into
the system at all. The recommended pattern is for a package with npm name `colin` to make an export of the same value
that will be assigned to the global namespace `colin` in its implementation — e.g.

```javascript

var colin = fluid.registerNamespace("colin");

// Add definitions to namespace colin, either directly or via fluid.defaults

module.exports = colin;
```

is a standard pattern for a module named `colin` — ensuring that the results of `var colin = require("colin")` and `var
colin = fluid.registerNamespace("colin")` will coincide in client code.

## node.js module APIs

Infusion includes a few small utilities to ease the process of working with a node/npm module layout:

### fluid.module.register(name, baseDir, moduleRequire)

This is an intensely useful method that will allow you to register your Infusion-aware module and its base path in
Infusion's global registry of modules. This will allow you, for example, to later issue a call to
`fluid.require("%myModule/myPath")` for any asset nested within that module, regardless of its location in the
filesystem. Other productive uses of such records are imaginable — for example, issuing `require` directives for modules
from their point of view, resolving cyclic references between modules, etc.

* `name {String}` The name of your module. This should agree with its name in the npm registry.
* `baseDir {String}` The base directory of your module. This should be the value of `__dirname` in its root directory.
* `moduleRequire {Require}` This should be the value of `require` handed to you by node's own module loader.

### fluid.module.resolvePath(path)

Resolve a path expression which may begin with a module reference of the form `%module-name` into an absolute path. Note
that more modules are resolvable here than were necessarily registered with `fluid.module.register` — on startup,
Infusion's node module will "pre-inspect" its filesystem path to the root in order to discover anything which plausibly
looks like a module root — that is, it will recognise a `package.json` file which need not necessarily have a
grandparent path of `node_nodules`. If the supplied path does not begin with such a module reference, it is returned
unchanged.

* `path {String}` A path expression to be resolved, perhaps containing symbolic module references such as `%module-name`
* Returns: `{String}` The path expression with any symbolic module references resolved against the
  `fluid.module.modules` database

### fluid.require(moduleName[, foreignRequire, namespace])

Issues node's `require` against a possibly symbolic path, and possibly also install the result at a particular global
namespace path from the point of view of Infusion.

* `moduleName {String}` A string to be supplied to node's `require`, possibly starting with a module reference of the
  form `%module-name` to indicate a base reference into an already loaded module that was previously registered using
  `fluid.module.register`.
* `foreignRequire {Require}` The instance of `require` to be operated after the module name has been interpolated. If
  omitted, defaults to Infusion's own `require` (which may not be able to see everything you can, as a result of its
  different position in the module tree)
* `namespace {String}` If this is supplied, the returned value from `require` will be written into Infusion's global
  namespace by using the [fluid.setGlobalValue](CoreAPI.md#fluidsetglobalvaluepath-value) API.

### fluid.module.modules

Holds for public inspection Infusion's records of modules as registered via `fluid.module.register`. This will be a hash
of `moduleName` to records of the following form:

* `baseDir {String}` the `baseDir` argument supplied to `fluid.module.register` for this module
* `require {Require}` the `moduleRequire` argument supplied to `fluid.module.register` for this module

## Global nature of Infusion and self-deduping

It is essential that just a **single** instance of Infusion's [node module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/infusion) is
present in an application's module tree. This is essential for Infusion because of its global nature — duplicate modules
will result in some [grade](ComponentGrades.md) definitions being sent to one Infusion instance and some to another,
resulting in "global chaos". Normally `npm`'s standard deduplication algorithm is sufficient, but it can often fail in
the case of version mismatches or else in the case the dependency is hosted from `git`. Infusion applies a special
algorithm at the point one issues `require("infusion")` to hunt upwards through the current module tree for the copy of
Infusion at the highest path, and return that one to the requestor, rather than the one resolved by the standard [node
module resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_all_together).

Normally this is completely transparent to users and occurs automatically — however, in some cases users may be
surprised by receiving a different version of Infusion than the one they expected — in practice, the one requested by
the top-level module in whatever application they are nested in, rather than the one the requested via their own
`package.json`.

This is an architectural risk that we are aware of — in that it requires that all the cooperating modules within an
Infusion application are compatible with a single version of Infusion, the one requested at the application's module
root. Future work on [modularization of
Infusion](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Notes+on+Modularisation+of+Infusion) will address this risk by
splitting Infusion into several smaller modules, only one of which (responsible for storing and retrieving grade
definitions and module paths) requires to be application-global.
