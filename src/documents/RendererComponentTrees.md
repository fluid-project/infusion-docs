A renderer **component tree** describes the UI in terms of **renderer components** (not to be confused with [Infusion
Components](UnderstandingInfusionComponents.md)). A renderer component is a data structure that represent the contents
and data binding function of a view, separate from any particular rendering of it. For example, the component
representing a 'selection' would include information regarding the available choices, the display strings associated
with the choices, and the current selection:

```json5
{
    optionlist: ["kitchen", "livingRoom", "bedroom", "diningRoom"],
    optionnames: ["Kitchen", "Living Room", "Bedroom", "Dining Room"],
    selection: "${myModel.roomChoice}"
}
```

The renderer component for the selection is independent of whether or not it is rendered using a `<select>` element, a
set of radio buttons, or a set of checkboxes.

## ProtoTrees

While the Renderer functions accept a full component tree as an argument, developers typically won't need to create
these trees directly. We expect developers to work with simpler structures called **protoTrees**, which are expanded
into full component trees using utility functions provided by the Renderer. The Renderer also provides functions for
generating common tree structures from other information, such as a data model.

### ProtoComponents

The Renderer categorizes components into different types depending on the nature of the data that is to be rendered.
Different component types will have different fields, but in general, the values of the fields will contain either the
actual data or a reference to a data model containing the data. For more information about the different protoComponent
types, see [ProtoComponent Types](ProtoComponentTypes.md).
