The Infusion Framework provides lots of supports for creating components. We have defined a number of different types,
or grades, of component, and the Framework will automatically set up different stuff for you depending on which grade of
component you create. (For more advanced information about grades, see [Component Grades](../ComponentGrades.md).)

The basic types are:

* **plain component**: the most basic type
* **model component**: for components that will have to maintain an abstract data model
* **view component**: for components that have a user interface
* **renderer component**: for components that want to render the user interface using a template

These types of components build upon each other, a teeny little bit like inheritance:

* **model** components add support for models to **plain components**
* **view components** support models, and also add support for views.
* **renderer components** are **view components** with the [Renderer](../Renderer.md) added.

For this tutorial, we suggest you work through all of the examples in order, to understand what each type of component
offers. That way, you'll be in a better position to decide which grade you'll need for your components. Regardless of
grade, the basic process for creating a component is the same. The next page in this tutorial will explain this basic
process using the **plain component**, but you will see the same process for each of the component types.
