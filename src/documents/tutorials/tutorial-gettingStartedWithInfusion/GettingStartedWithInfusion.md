Ok, you're convinced: The Infusion Framework looks like it has some cool stuff, and you want to use it in your
application. This tutorial will walk you through concepts you'll need to know and how to implement them when developing
full applications locally with Infusion. It starts simple and builds in complexity as it goes. Along the way, you'll
find links to more documentation about the concepts you'll be learning.

    <strong>Note:</strong> We recommend starting with the <a

    Introduction to the Infusion Framework</a> if you are looking at Infusion for the first time.

## Building Components

The building blocks of Infusion applications are components. If you haven't already, you might want read [Understanding
Infusion Components](../UnderstandingInfusionComponents.md) to learn what we mean when we say components, and why we use
them.

If you want to use Infusion for application development, you'll likely want to create components. Here's how:

1. [Set up your environment](SetUpYourEnvironment.md)
2. [Define a namespace and create a closure](DefineANamespaceAndCreateAClosure.md)
3. [Pick a component type](PickAComponentType.md)
4. [Basic Component Creation - Plain Components](BasicComponentCreation-Components.md)
    * [Model Components](ModelComponents.md)
    * [View Components](ViewComponents.md)
    * [Renderer Components](RendererComponents.md)
5. [Subcomponents](Subcomponents.md)
