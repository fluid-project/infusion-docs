The Infusion Framework includes a client-side **Renderer** that allows users to create user interface templates in pure
HTML, and render the pages entirely on the client side. The Renderer offers a clean separation of Model and View: it
works with internal [Renderer Component Trees](RendererComponentTrees.md) that are independent of the mark-up,
supporting the Infusion goal of [markup agnosticism](FrameworkConcepts.md).

This page provides resources to help you learn about the Renderer and how to use it.
