title: Declarative this-ism in IoC
layout: default
category: Infusion

Typically in Infusion, all functions and components adhere to a **that-ist** approach. This approach implies that the
meaning of any function value remains the same, however the function is invoked. This is in contrast to the **this-ist**
approach used frequently in JavaScript code, where the context of a function (the value of `this` within its body)
depends on where the caller has stored it before invoking it. When working with Infusion, there are times when you will
need to interact with a library and or function that requires a `this`, which is a keyword typically intended to refer
back to itself. The most common example would be using a jQuery element.

For more details on the differences between **that-ist** and **this-ist** approaches, as well as the reasoning behind
why Infusion employs the former, see the [About this and
that](http://fluidproject.org/blog/2008/07/21/about-this-and-that/) blog post.

## Structure

A **this-ist** function can be declaratively bound to [invokers](Invokers.md) and listeners in an IoC tree and takes the
following structure:

```json5
{
    "this": "{that}.dom.elm",
    "method": "click",
    "args": ["console.log"]
}
```

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>"this"</td>
            <td>
                <p>
                    The <code>this</code> required by the function; the object that the function will be called on. Note
                    that this property name must include the quotes (" ").
                </p>
                <p>e.g. a jQuery object</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>method</td>
            <td>
                <p>The name of the function to be called.</p>
                <p>e.g. a jQuery function like "click"</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>args</td>
            <td>
                <em>(Optional)</em> The argument or array of arguments to be passed into the function. This can include
                <a href="IoCReferences.md">IoC References</a> and expanders, in addition to strings, objects, booleans,
                etc.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>namespace</td>
            <td>
                <em>(Optional)</em>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Examples

In the following example, a **this-ist** function is used to attach a listener to the `onCreate` events: The jQuery
`click()` function of the button identified by the `button` selector is used to bind the component's `writeText()`
method to the click event.

```javascript
fluid.defaults("demo.hw", {
    gradeNames: ["fluid.viewComponent"],
    selectors: {
        button: "demo-hw-button",
        title: "demo-hw-title"
    },
    strings: {
        title: "Hello World!"
    },
    invokers: {
        // writes the supplied string to the title element
        writeText: {
            "this": "{that}.dom.title",
            "method": "text",
            "args": ["{that}.options.strings.title"]
        }
    },
    listeners: {
        // binds a click handler to the button element
        onCreate: {
            "this": "{that}.dom.button",
            "method": "click",
            "args": ["{that}.writeText"]
        }
    }
});
```

In the following example, taken from the Infusion Table of Contents component, **this-ist** functions are used to attach
methods to the component object in the `invokers` option.

```javascript
fluid.defaults("fluid.tableOfContents", {
    gradeNames: ["fluid.viewComponent"],
    // ...
    invokers: {
        // ...
        hide: {
            "this": "{that}.dom.tocContainer",
            "method": "hide"
        },
        show: {
            "this": "{that}.dom.tocContainer",
            "method": "show"
        }
    }
    //...
});
```

In the following example, taken from the Infusion Inline Edit component, a **this-ist** function is used to invoke the
`init` function on the tinyMCE object associated with the component as a listener on the `onCreate` event.

```javascript
fluid.defaults("fluid.inlineEdit.tinyMCE", {
    gradeNames: ["fluid.inlineEdit"],
    listeners: {
        onCreate: {
            "this": "tinyMCE",
            method: "init",
            namespace: "initTinyMCE",
            args: "{that}.options.tinyMCE"
        }
    }
    // ...
});
```

In the following example, taken from the Infusion Pager component, a **this-ist** function is used to set the
container's `role` attribute to _"application"_ using the jQuery `attr()` function.

```javascript
fluid.defaults("fluid.pager", {
    gradeNames: ["fluid.viewComponent"],
    // ...
    listeners: {
        onCreate: {
            "this": "{that}.container",
            method: "attr",
            args: ["role", "application"]
        }
        // ...
    }
});
```
